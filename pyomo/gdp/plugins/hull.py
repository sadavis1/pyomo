    """Relax disjunctive model by forming the hull reformulation.

    Relaxes a disjunctive model into an algebraic model by forming the
    hull reformulation of each disjunction.

    This transformation accepts the following keyword arguments:

    The transformation will create a new Block with a unique
    name beginning "_pyomo_gdp_hull_reformulation". It will contain an
    indexed Block named "relaxedDisjuncts" that will hold the relaxed
    disjuncts. This block is indexed by an integer indicating the order
    in which the disjuncts were relaxed. All transformed Disjuncts will
    have a pointer to the block their transformed constraints are on,
    and all transformed Disjunctions will have a pointer to the
    corresponding OR or XOR constraint.

        The perspective function used to transform nonlinear functions

        "LeeGrossmann" is the original NL convex hull from Lee &
        Grossmann (2000) [1]_, which substitutes nonlinear constraints

            h_ik(x) <= 0

        with

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            y_ik * h_ik( nu_ik/y_ik ) <= 0

        "GrossmannLee" is an updated formulation from Grossmann &
        Lee (2003) [2]_, which avoids divide-by-0 errors by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            (y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/(y_ik + eps) ) <= 0

        "FurmanSawayaGrossmann" (default) is an improved relaxation [3]_
        that is exact at 0 and 1 while avoiding numerical issues from
        the Lee & Grossmann formulation by using:

            x_k = sum( nu_ik )
            ((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) * h_ik( nu_ik/((1-eps)*y_ik + eps) ) \
                - eps * h_ki(0) * ( 1-y_ik ) <= 0


         The default, "FurmanSawayaGrossmann", is strongly
         recommended. When "FurmanSawayaGrossmann" is used, any value of
         epsilon in (0, 1) leads to an exact reformulation, and
         decreasing epsilon improves the quality of the continuous
         relaxation (see [3]_). When "GrossmannLee" is used, epsilon
         should be set very small, as the formulation is only correct in
         the epsilon -> 0 limit. In particular, it should be small
         enough to put spurious O(eps) sized constraint violations
         within solver tolerances. Both "GrossmannLee" (when epsilon is
         small enough) and the original "LeeGrossmann" have serious
         numerical issues.
